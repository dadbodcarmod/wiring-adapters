DadBodCarMod Wiring Adapters
============================

Wiring adapters for the various cars we modify.

While we sometimes do custom wiring, one of the goals of our projects is to
simplify these projects so the average "dad bod" can do these to their own cars.
These adapters are ones we've created to minimize the required wiring changes to
our stock-ish cars.

Corolla 2006 DBW Dash to ADU
----------------------------

This adapter is for connecting an ECU Masters Advanced Display Unit (ADU) to the
stock dash connector on a Toyota Corolla.  This will likely work on other models
that have a similar dash.  It's intended to be used with a car using the ECU
Masters EMU Black engine computer, so many of the stock light/functions aren't
connected (e.g. tachometer comes via CAN bus instead of stock pin).

 * For EMU Master Advanced Display Unit (ADU)
 * For use with ECU Master EMU Black (likely will work with EMU Classic)
 * For use on Toyota Corolla 2003 to 2006 (tested on 2003 and 2006)
 * For use on Drive-by-Wire (DBW) and non-DBW cars
 * For use on cars without Anti-lock Braking System (ABS); two or three changes
   required for ABS
